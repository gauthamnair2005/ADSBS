--   Review generated scripts for bugs trying to figure out if are due fails
     in the Bds book XML tagging (that will implied that the book need be
     fixed) or are required variations due book layout. If the latter, try
     to fix it via XSL, documenting in README.Bds that issues that can't be
     fixed.

     This is an on-going and never-end task due that, ideally, each commit to
     the Bds book should be revised and validated, but our time is limited.

--   Bugs hunting.
